# The One True Awk

This is the version of `awk` described in _The AWK Programming Language_,
by Al Aho, Brian Kernighan, and Peter Weinberger
(Addison-Wesley, 1988, ISBN 0-201-07981-X).

## Distribution and Reporting Problems

Changes, mostly bug fixes and occasional enhancements, are listed
in `FIXES`.  If you distribute this code further, please please please
distribute `FIXES` with it.

If you find errors, please report them
to bwk@cs.princeton.edu.
Please _also_ open an issue in the GitHub issue tracker, to make

Thanks.

## Submitting Pull Requests

Pull requests are welcome.  However, please create them with a request
to merge into the `staging` branch instead of into the `master` branch.
This allows us to do testing, and to make any additional edits or changes
after the merge but before merging to `master`.

## Building

The program itself is created by

	make

which should produce a sequence of messages roughly like this:

	yacc -d awkgram.y
	conflicts: 43 shift/reduce, 85 reduce/reduce
	mv y.tab.c ytab.c
	mv y.tab.h ytab.h
	cc -c ytab.c
	cc -c b.c
	cc -c main.c
	cc -c parse.c
	cc maketab.c -o maketab
	./maketab >proctab.c
	cc -c proctab.c
	cc -c tran.c
	cc -c lib.c
	cc -c run.c
	cc -c lex.c
	cc ytab.o b.o main.o parse.o proctab.o tran.o lib.o run.o lex.o -lm

This produces an executable `a.out`; you will eventually want to
move this to some place like `/usr/bin/awk`.

If your system does not have `yacc` or `bison` (the GNU
equivalent), you need to install one of them first.

NOTE: This version uses ANSI C (C 99), as you should also.  We have
compiled this without any changes using `gcc -Wall` and/or local C
compilers on a variety of systems, but new systems or compilers
may raise some new complaint; reports of difficulties are
welcome.

This compiles without change on Macintosh OS X using `gcc` and
the standard developer tools.

The version of `malloc` that comes with some systems is sometimes
astonishly slow.  If `awk` seems slow, you might try fixing that.
More generally, turning on optimization can significantly improve
`awk`'s speed, perhaps by 1/3 for highest levels.
